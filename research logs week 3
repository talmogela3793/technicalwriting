A zine is short for magazine, literally a short magazine. They come from people who are within the specific dates on the timeline like different eras. They were used for revolutionary statements and also to be part of the trends.

People write make zines to be expressive, sentimental, to feel something, or just create whatever. Like I said, it can also be used for a bold statement and create trends. 

They may be important because there are really no limits, but at least compose some sort of message that you are trying to express and I think that's the most important thing because it can be anything you want to create. 

I can give us an idea of what the type and purpose of zine we should make specifically for a group of people or audience. There has to be some of theme going on that is consistent for the reader can feel what the writer was feeling. The fun thing about zines is that it deoesn't have to only be texts and words but connected with images and drawings to make the zine pop out. 

The conventions that make zines stand out as its own kind are choosing what it's for, it's purpose, having a certain layout and order, making a master copy as if it's your own, and being able to distribute it with others so you can connect with people and possibly make money off of it.
